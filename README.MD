# Linked List Implementation in C

## Description
This project provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C. It supports various operations such as adding, deleting, searching, sorting, and reversing the linked list. It also includes utility functions for recursive printing and size tracking.

## Features
- **Encapsulated List Structure**: Includes a `List` structure with size tracking.
- **Memory Management**: Handles dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Operations**:
  - Add nodes at the beginning, end, or specific positions.
  - Delete nodes by value, by position, or from the beginning/end.
  - Search for values and find their positions.
  - Reverse or sort the list.
- **Utility Functions**: Print the list (both normally and in reverse), track size, and more.

## Usage
### Compilation
Use a standard C compiler to compile the program:
```bash
gcc -o list linked_list.c && ./list
